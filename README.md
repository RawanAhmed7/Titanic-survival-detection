This project applies logistic regression to the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict which passengers survived the disaster.
The goal is to demonstrate basic machine learning workflow: data preprocessing, training, evaluating, and interpreting a simple classification model.
## Features
- Load and explore the Titanic dataset
- Handle missing values and clean data
- Encode categorical features
- Train a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance
